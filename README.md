# Frontend Mentor Challenges

In this Repository i will upload all challenges I complete from [Frontend](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I am not planning to do every single challenge in the page, but I will upload the challenge here as I complete it.

## Challenges

This is the list of the challenges I've completed or I'm completing. Some of the challenges have their own repository because I used a framework, a special tool or the project is more complex than the other ones in this repo and I wanted to work with it individually. But even if the challenge is in it's own repository, I will make a reference to it here.
